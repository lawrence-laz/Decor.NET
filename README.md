### What is it?
Sometimes there is a need to write code that should affect a big part of a code base, like logging, performance tracking, etc. But adding this unrelated code to each method is messy. Instead of that, code can be written in one place and attached dynamically where needed.

Decor makes it easy to add additional behaviour to existing methods using the C# attributes and without modifying the target method's body.

### How to get started?
Create a decorator implementing `IDecorator` or `IDecoratorAsync` interfaces. For example a profiler decorator would look like this:
```csharp
public class ProfilerDecorator : IDecorator // Asynchronous alternative is IDecoratorAsync.
{
    public ILogger Logger { get; }
    
    public ProfilerDecorator(ILogger logger)
    {
        // Dependency injection provided by NuGet package Decor.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection.
        Logger = logger;
    }

    public void OnBefore(CallInfo callInfo)
    {
        // State is any object to be transfered between OnBefore and OnAfter.
        callInfo.SetState(Stopwatch.StartNew());
    }

    public void OnAfter(CallInfo callInfo)
    {
        var methodName = callInfo.Method.Name;
        var elapsedTime = callInfo.GetState<Stopwatch>().ElapsedMilliseconds;
        Logger.Log($"Method {methodName} took {elapsedTime} ms to execute.");
    }
}
```
Apply a decorator to appropriate methods using the attribute `[Decorate(typeof(...))]`.
```csharp
public class SomeClass
{
    [Decorate(typeof(LoggingDecorator))]
    public virtual void SomeMethod() 
    {
        // The code inside the decorated method is left unchanged. 
    }
}
```
Add Decor, the created decorator and the decorated class to dependency container.
```csharp
services.AddDecor()
    .AddTransient<LoggingDecorator>()
    .AddTransientDecorated<SomeClass>(); 
    // Notice the '...Decorated' postfix. It is needed for `[Decorate]` attribute to take effect.
```
And that's it! Each time the method with an attribute is invokedâ€”the respective decorator will be invoked as well.
