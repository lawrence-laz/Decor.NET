### What is it?
Sometimes there is a need to write code that should affect a big part of a code base, like logging, performance tracking, etc. But adding this unrelated code to each method is messy. Instead of that, code can be written in one place and attached dynamically where needed.

Decor makes it easy to add additional behaviour to existing methods using the C# attributes and without modifying the target method's body.

### How to get started?
Create a decorator for cross-cutting code like logging.
```csharp
public class LoggingDecorator : IDecorator
{
    public void OnBefore(CallInfo callInfo)
    {
        // Do the logging before method is called here...
    }

    public void OnAfter(CallInfo callInfo)
    {
        // And after the method here...
    }
}
```
Apply a decorator to appropriate methods using the attribute `[Decorate(typeof(...))]`.
```csharp
public class SomeClass
{
    [Decorate(typeof(LoggingDecorator))]
    public virtual void SomeMethod() 
    {
        // The code inside the decorated method is left unchanged. 
    }
}
```
Add Decor, the created decorator and the decorated class to dependency container.
```csharp
services.AddDecor()
    .AddTransient<LoggingDecorator>()
    .AddTransientDecorated<SomeClass>();
```
And that's it! Each time the method with an attribute is invokedâ€”the respective decorator will be invoked as well.
